## Hi there 👋 HTML | CSS | Bootstrap | JS | REACT  Next stop --> PYTHON
I'm MJ, driven by my passion for digital healthcare and the transformative power of technology in the health field 🩺 I'm currently embarking ⛵ on an exciting journey into the Tech realm (ON 4GEEKS ACADEMY) 😎, where I'm developing my skills in Full Stack development 💻.

⚡ Fun fact: Pink flamingos are not born with that color 🦩, and I am looking to expand my skill set and explore 🗺️ new career opportunities while building upon my background in healthcare.
